            <span>Welcome to our exciting shapes adventure! <br>Today, we are going to discover the amazing world of shapes. Shapes are all around us, and they help us understand and describe the things we see.<br><br>



                What Are Shapes?<br>

                Shapes are like the building blocks of everything! They are the different forms <br>that objects can have. Let's get to know some special shapes:<br><br>

                

                Circle: A circle is round, like a delicious pizza or the sun in the sky. Can you think of something else that's shaped like a circle?<br><br>

                

                Square: A square has four equal sides, just like a perfect sandwich or a picture frame. Look around—can you find anything square in your room?<br><br>

                

                Triangle: A triangle has three sides, like a slice of pizza or the roof of a house. Triangles are super cool!<br><br>

                

                Rectangle: A rectangle is like a stretched-out square. It has two long sides and two short sides, just like a book or a door. What else can you find that's shaped like a rectangle?<br><br>

                

                Let's Find Shapes!<br>

                Now, let's go on a shape hunt! Look around your room or your house. Can you find circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles? Count how many you see!<br><br>

                

                Shape Art Time<br>

                Grab your crayons and paper—it's time to create! Draw a big circle, a square house, a triangle tree, or a rectangle door. Use your imagination and make your shapes colorful!<br><br>

                

                Sorting Shapes<br>

                Let's sort some objects by their shapes! Grab a few toys or items from around your house. Can you sort them into groups of circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles?<br><br>

                

                

                

                Shape Challenge<br>

                Your shape challenge is to find the most unique or interesting shape in your house. It could be a special toy, a picture frame, or even a piece of furniture. Describe it to your friends or family!<br><br></span>
