            From "Mom" and "Dad" to "teacher" and "friend," people nouns make our language personal and full of familiar faces.<br> <br>

            "School," "park," "home," and "beach" are like magic words that transport us to different places in our minds. They help us share exciting adventures! <br> <br> 

            

            4. Thing Nouns - Our Everyday Treasures: <br> 

            Thing nouns are like the treasures we find in our daily lives. <br> <br> 

            From "toys" and "books" to "snacks" and "beds," these words give names to the objects we interact with every day. Thing nouns make our world rich and interesting.<br> <br> 

            

            5. Animal Nouns - Our Furry and Feathery Friends: <br> 

            Animals have their own special names too! "Dog," "cat," "bird," and "fish" are like the characters in the grand story of nature. <br> <br> 

            Animal nouns let us talk about the amazing creatures that share our world.<br> <br> </p>
